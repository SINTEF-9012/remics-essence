REMICS Essence Method Library
==============

This repository contains the Essence method library for selected parts of the REMICS Methodology (see http://remics.modelbased.net)

The original REMICS Methodology was developed using the EFP Composer (see http://www.eclipse.org/epf/).
Selected parts of the methodology was redefined in the EssWork Practice Workbench (see http://www.ivarjacobson.com/EssWork_Practice_Workbench/) to compare and evaluate the Essence specification.
