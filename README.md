REMICS Essence Method Library
==============

This repository contains the Essence method library for selected parts of the REMICS Methodology (see http://remics.modelbased.net)

The original REMICS Methodology was developed using the EFP Composer (see http://www.eclipse.org/epf/) which is based on the
SPEM 2.0 specification (see http://www.omg.org/spec/SPEM/2.0/)

Selected parts of the REMICS Methodology were redefined in the EssWork Practice Workbench 
(see http://www.ivarjacobson.com/EssWork_Practice_Workbench/) which is based on the Essence 1.0 draft specification 
(see http://semat.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2012-11-01.pdf) to evaluate the Essence approach and compare it to SPEM 2.0.
